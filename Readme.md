## üîî Updates

- 2024-05-26 We released the first version of the base RAG framework that can support configurations

## üöÄ Deploy

### Making the necessary modifications

Clone code from our repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charon-ops/RegisterRAG.git
```

**Before launching the service, please modify the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your GPU configuration.** Our server is equipped with four graphics cards, and we have deployed all services except for the `zip` service on the third card. You will need to adjust the `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` setting to match the GPU configuration of your own computer.

At the same time, you also need to **modify the mount point of the store service**. Specifically, change the `volumes` section in the `store` service to `path/to/your/data:/app/data`.

### Starting the Service

After making the necessary modifications, you can start the service using the `docker-compose.yml` file. If you haven't previously built the process, it will automatically build without any manual intervention required.

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up
cd ..
```

Wait for the container to start successfully, register rag deployed successfully.

### Running in Detached Mode

If you prefer not to automatically attach to the container, you can add the `-d` parameter to run in detached mode. For example:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
cd ..
```

### Building Process

The building process involves downloading weights, which by default uses the [hf-mirror](https://hf-mirror.com/) repository. You can modify the `HF_ENDPOINT` setting in the Dockerfile to better suit your network conditions. Please note, due to the substantial size of the weights, this process might take some time.

### Starting Specific Services

If you prefer to start only certain services, use the command below:

``` bash
docker-compose up embedding
```

This will launch only the `embedding` service.

### Stopping the Service

When you need to stop the service, navigate to the Docker directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose down
```

This will terminate all running containers associated with the service.

## üìà Usage

Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

If you want to customise your own RAG framework, you can configure it by modifying the app_register_config.json file. See the [Config](#Ô∏è-config) section for details on configuring the fields in the json file.

```bash
vim app_register_config.json
```

Start the Register RAG service (default port is 8000)

```bash
uvicorn service:service
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

Specific configuration details are detailed in the following demo code block. You can modify the name field and configure the corresponding args field correctly. Please refer to the config_reference.md file for the detailed field correspondences.
