    "response": "The main changes in architecture are:\n- Use of a larger model size (from 128 to 384)\n- Reduced size of the vocabulary (from 21,000 to 10,000)\n\nThese changes were made due to improvements in performance and reducing complexity. The larger model size allowed the model to learn more features and the reduced size of the vocabulary provided more flexibility in learning new words while still maintaining meaningful representations."
